/*
 * Implement a class Car with the following properties. 
 * A car has a certain fuel efficiency 
 * (measured in miles/gallon or liters/kmâ€”pick one) 
 * and a certain amount of fuel in the gas tank. 
 * The efficiency is specified in the constructor, 
 * and the initial fuel level is 0. 
 * Supply a method drive that simulates driving the car for a certain 
 * distance, reducing the fuel level in the gas tank, and methods 
 * getFuelLevel, returning the current fuel level, and tank, to tank up. 
 * Sample usage:
 * Car mycar = new Car(29); // 29 miles per gallon
 * mycar.tank(20); // tank 20 gallons
 * mycar.drive(100); // drive 100 miles
 * System.out.println(mycar.getFuelLevel());
