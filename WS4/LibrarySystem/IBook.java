/*
Consider the following   diagram that represents a library system 
that records the books that have been borrowed. 
There are three kinds of books: regular books, reference books,
 and audio books. 
 Reference books can be taken out for just two days, 
 while other kinds of books may be borrowed for two weeks. 
 The overdue fees are Rs.1/- per day for reference books and regular books,
  and Rs.2/- per day for audio books.
Audio books and regular books have both authors and titles; 
reference books only have titles.
The day when the book is taken out and the day due are counted as days 
since the library opened on New Yearâ€™s Day in 2019.

               | Book |
               +-------+
                   |

Design the classes that represent the library borrowing system.
Define the abstract class  Book and lift those fields that can be lifted to this class.
Design the method daysOverdue that consumes the number that represents today in the library date-recording system and produces the number of days this book is overdue. If the number is negative, the book can still be out for that many days.
Design the method isOverdue that produces a boolean value that informs us whether the book is overdue on the given day.
Design the method computeFine that computes the fine for this book, if the book is returned on the given day.
Implement the above specifications carefully with an  abstract class and  concrete classes.
