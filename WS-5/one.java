/*
This structure contains two classes in which ShortAnswerQuestion inherits from Question. To build the classes shown in the figure, note the following:
The Question class is a new class with the following features: 
It is an abstract class;
It includes a constructor method that receives a String and stores it in the private variable myText;
It includes a public accessor method getText() for myText; 
It includes abstract method specifications for getQuestion(), getAnswer() and checkAnswer(), whose signatures should match those used in the original ShortAnswerQuestion; 
The ShortAnswerQuestion class is just like the original with the following modifications: 
It now extends the Question class; 
It inherits myText and its getText() accessor method from Question so it doesnâ€™t need to implement it anymore; 
Its constructor method starts with a call to super(text), where text is the parameter holding the question text; 
Its three concrete method definitions are marked with @Override to alert the programming environment that their signatures should match the inherited abstract method signatures. 
The getQuestion() accessor method calls the parent method getText() in order to gain access to the text instance variable.
